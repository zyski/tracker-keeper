# tracker-keeper

What did I do today? A simple task and time tracker.

## Setup

It's built as a node application, so run npm install to install components. 
A http-server is supplied, run npm start to kick it off.
The application is all front end, and will store its data in the browsers localStorage object.
Only tested with Chrome, so your mileage will vary with other browsers.

## About

I wanted to learn javascript, so found myself building something I could use and evolve.
This is the result. Of course, still lots to learn, clean up and tweak!
