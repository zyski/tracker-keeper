# tracker-keeper

What did I do today? A simple task and time tracker.

## Setup

It should run as a nodejs application after installing dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Start your web server:

```
npm start
```

Point your browser to the running web server

```
http://localhost:8888/app
```

## Notes

Missing some dependencies... crossfilter, highcharts, and my own lib
to glue highcharts and crossfilter together.

This application is all front end, and will store its data in the browsers 
localStorage object. Only tested with Chrome, so your mileage will vary with
other browsers.

## About

I wanted to learn javascript, and my wife and I needed a simple time 
sheeting application. This is the result.
